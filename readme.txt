== Description ==

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Follow the instructions here to setup your memberships: http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/support/initial-plugin-setup/

== Changelog ==
= 1.1.12 =
* Revenue report on members list page. (Rought estimate only that doesn't take into account trial periods and billing limits.)
* Enabling weekly recurring payments for Authorize.net by converting week period to 7 days * # months.
* Improved error handling on checkout page.
* Now running "pmpro_after_change_membership_level" actions after the "pmpro_after_checkout" action. Previously this hook was only called when a membership level was changed via the WP admin.		
* Won't complain about setting up a Payment Gateway if you only have free membership levels.
* The "besecure" custom field is not added to the billing or checkout by default anymore when you run the "create the pages for me" option in the settings. Whether or not to use HTTPS on a page is now handled in the preheader files for each page (see below).
* The plugin won't force SSL on the checkout page anymore unless the membership level requires payment. If your checkout page is still running over HTTPS/SSL for free membership checkouts, make sure the "besecure" custom field has been deleted on your checkout page. You can use the "besecure" custom field or the "pmpro_besecure" filter to override the plugin's decision.
* The plugin won't force SSL on the cancel page anymore. Again, you can override this using the "besecure" custom field or the "pmpro_besecure" filter.
							
= 1.1.11 =
* Removed some debug code from the invoice page that might have shown on error.
